    <h2 id="register">Register and login</h2>

    <p>Before participating you should register an account and log
    in. You can contribute anonymously as well, but we'd like to give
    you credit and possibly offer money for your contribution. You can
    optionally add a profile picture after registering.</p>

    <h2 id="reading">Reading and revealing illustrations</h2>

    <img src="http://bookses.asset.s3.amazonaws.com/clickbook.png">

    <p>Before opening a book you have to agree to a disclaimer or
    verify that you're not going to be submitting art to the
    book. It's short and written for humans so please take a moment to
    make sure you understand it.</p>

    <img src="http://bookses.asset.s3.amazonaws.com/disclaimer.png">

    <p>Now you can start reading the book. The illustrations are
    initially hidden. You can reveal them by clicking on
    paragraphs marked with a green bar.</p>

    <h2 id="addingnew">Adding a new illustration</h2>

    <p>You can add a new illustration to a paragraph by first cliking
    on it to open the orange menu, then clicking on the "Add an
    illustration" button.</p>

    <h2 id="topview">Seeing everyone else's works</h2>

    <p>At the top of the window is a convenient button that will bring
    you to the top of the page, where you can see the Latest Activity
    tab. Clicking on any of the thumbnails will bring you to the
    corresponding paragraph and open the full size illustration.</p>

    <h2 id="collaborating">Collaborating on an illustration</h2>

    <p>To avoid conflict and focus effort, during live sprint sessions
    please remember to lock the drawings before you download and work
    on a new version. It's also good practice in general. This will
    let other artists know that you've started working on the
    illustration, so they can work on something else. The lock will
    expire 10 minutes later. At the end of the round you can submit
    your new work like before.</p>
