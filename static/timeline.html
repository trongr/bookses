    <h1>Project Timeline</h1>

    <h2>Note</h2>

    <p>
        Each of the following stages involves two images, and you
        should spend approx. half an hour on each one.
    </p>

    <h2>Monday 6 PM. Chosen two scenes</h2>

    <p>
        <b><i>Requirements</i></b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please choose scenes in both halves of the story. We want
                to spread the illustrations out so they don't all clump
                together in the beginning of the story.
            </li>
            <li>
                As much as possible try to choose visually exciting /
                dynamic / action scenes, where the characters are actually
                doing something.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Once OK'd, start designing main / recurring characters in
        those scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>Requirements</i></b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Draw the entire body, what they look like, what they wear,
                accessories, etc. If your scene happens to show their entire
                bodies, draw the scene instead of the character designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designs can be rough and sketchy, but they need to be
                in color and have enough details that other artists
                can work from.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don't have a well developed style, go for
                realism, or at least realistic proportions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Thursday 6 PM. Designs due</h2>

    <p>
        I'll go through everyone's designs and choose the best one for
        each character, and we'll all work from those. I'll take votes
        into account so vote away :)
    </p>

    <p>
        Once chosen, start illustrating your two scenes with
        characters based on the official designs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>Requirements</i></b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Draw your characters in the same style as the official
                designs. And the characters must be colored.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please post your illustrations as you finish
                them. Don't wait until the deadline to submit both
                images.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Saturday 6 PM. Scenes v1 due</h2>

    <p>
        Call dibs on images you want to improve, and start editing.
    </p>

    <p id="editing101">
        <b><i>Requirements</i></b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Focus on places with the least details, e.g. blank or
                sketchy areas. Don't overwork an area if there's a
                blank spot right next to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The most important thing to remember about editing
                    is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please add <i>actual</i> things rather
                    than <i>artistic</i> things. Examples of actual
                    things: trees, rocks, hills, mountains, birds,
                    light, shadows, waves, boats, clouds, palaces,
                    eyes, etc. Those are great. Examples of artistic
                    things: adjusting saturation, contrast, hues,
                    tones, filters, generic brush patterns, etc. Don't
                    do that. Spend more time thinking about actual
                    things that contribute to the composition. The
                    more things the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? Because actual things are (literally) more
                    substantial than special effects, and it's more
                    fun to watch that transformation. E.g. consider
                    this
                    <a href="http://bookses.img.s3.amazonaws.com/53928fa64b0d409f6c00000d.png"
                    target="_blank">original,</a> and two different
                    edits:
                    <a href="http://bookses.img.s3.amazonaws.com/539582534b0d409f6c00004f.png"
                    target="_blank">actual</a> versus
                    <a href="http://bookses.img.s3.amazonaws.com/539c85c1980bc8961b00001d.png"
                    target="_blank">artistic.</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Monday 6 PM. Scenes v2 due</h2>

    <p>
        By this point the illustrations should be more or less
        finished, maybe lacking a few details but the bulk of the work
        should be done. For those that are finished I'll put up a
        comment to close them. Those that aren't will go on for more
        editing. Since there'll be more artists than edits I'll be
        assigning them individually, depending on who's available and
        willing.
